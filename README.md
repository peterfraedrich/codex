<h1>CODEX</h1>
<h3>Lightweight metadata repository for your enterprise environment; with a web GUI.</h3>
Keeping track of all of your network-attached devices can be a full-time job in itself. With enterprise environments getting larger and larger -- thanks to the explosion of server and desktop virtualization -- the old standby of keeping a simple spreadsheet simply won't do anymore. What you need is searchable database of all of your hosts accessible from anywhere in your network; what you need is Codex.
<br><br>
Codex gives you the ability to find any host quickly with real-time search of any data field, categorize your hosts by type (server, workstation, network device, etc.), and even reserve IP addresses for future additions. Additionally, Codex gives you a one-look dashboard to check if your hosts are up or down, thanks to server-side scripting that will periodically ping all of your hosts using multi-threaded scripting so your server resources can more quickly be used for other more important tasks.
<br><br>
Based on the ultra-stable Node.JS web server, an AngularJS front-end, a no-SQL/JSON MongoDB database, and Python 2.7 keeping things neat and running behind the scenes, Codex is a lightweight metadata repository that can keep you on top of your topology. For advanced deployments, Codex can be broken into two main parts: the app server and the database server, allowing for database load-balancing, streamlined cloud deployment, and any other configuration to suit your needs.
<br><br>
Codex is designed to be run on CentOS 6.5 (and probably other RHEL-based distros like RHEL, Fedora, and Scientific Linux, we just haven't tested those yet) and is available as a virutal machine in your flavor of choice or as a Docker container (you could run it on a physical server, but why waste the resources?).
