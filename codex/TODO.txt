STV 2 
=====

TO DO:

- make v/p variable defines on system discovery instead of "undefined" (use "unknown or something, or find a way to query CPU arch and get CPU type)
- take extra columns (subnet, VLAN, location, girt-host, cp, added by, last up, date added) and move to "more info / edit" window & clean up rest of table, make text larger, etc.
- threaded python
- UI branding, coloring, and consistency
- add "hidden" attributes to hosts for ng-filter and ng-repeat sorting and filtering
- change default VLAN to 1
- add "view options" panel to hide/show columns in default view (use CSS for show/hide function)
- color-coded health statuses
- change all "undefined" default values to blank values
- add "domain" field for sorting by multiple domains, make domain default sort (?)

- ADD DNS TO TABLE
- DNS LOOKUP FOR MANUAL ENTRY
- fix health status
- python modules lol
